    abstract = "Understanding attitudes expressed in texts, also known as stance detection, plays an important role in systems for detecting false information online, be it misinformation (unintentionally false) or disinformation (intentionally false information). Stance detection has been framed in different ways, including (a) as a component of fact-checking, rumour detection, and detecting previously fact-checked claims, or (b) as a task in its own right. While there have been prior efforts to contrast stance detection with other related tasks such as argumentation mining and sentiment analysis, there is no existing survey on examining the relationship between stance detection and mis- and disinformation detection. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by reviewing and analysing existing work in this area, with mis- and disinformation in focus, and discussing lessons learnt and future challenges.",

In this paper, we propose a multi-task framework that incorporates target-specific attention mechanism and at the same time takes sentiment classification as an auxiliary task. Moreover, we used a sentiment lexicon and constructed a stance lexicon to provide guidance for the attention layer. Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods on the SemEval-2016 dataset.",

abstract = {Numerous domains have interests in studying the viewpoints expressed online, be it for marketing, cybersecurity, or research purposes with the rise of computational social sciences. Current stance detection models are usually grounded on the specificities of some social platforms. This rigidity is unfortunate since it does not allow the integration of the multitude of signals informing effective stance detection. We propose the SCSD model, or Sequential Community-based Stance Detection model, a semi-supervised ensemble algorithm which considers these signals by modeling them as a multi-layer graph representing proximities between profiles. We use a handful of seed profiles, for whom we know the stance, to classify the rest of the profiles by exploiting like-minded communities. These communities represent profiles close enough to assume they share a similar stance on a given subject. Using datasets from two different social platforms, containing two to five stances, we show that by combining several types of proximity we can achieve excellent results. Moreover, we compare the proximities to find those which convey useful information in term of stance detection.},

    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

abstract = {In the 19th and 20th centuries, social networks have been an important topic in a wide range of fields from sociology to education. However, with the advances in computer technology in the 21st century, significant changes have been observed in social networks, and conventional networks have evolved into online social networks. The size of these networks, along with the large amount of data they generate, has introduced new social networking problems and solutions. Social network analysis methods are used to understand social network data. Today, several methods are implemented to solve various social network analysis problems, albeit with limited success in certain problems. Thus, the researchers develop new methods or recommend solutions to improve the performance of the existing methods. In the present paper, a novel optimization method that aimed to classify social network analysis problems was proposed. The problem of stance detection, an online social network analysis problem, was first tackled as an optimization problem. Furthermore, a new hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm was proposed for the first time in the current study, and the algorithm was compared with various methods. The analysis of the findings obtained with accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure classification metrics demonstrated that our method performed better than other methods.}

There has been a growing research interest for developing effective methods for stance detection methods varying among multiple communities including natural language processing, web science, and social computing, where each modeled stance detection in different ways. In this paper, we survey the work on stance detection across those communities and present an exhaustive review of stance detection techniques on social media, including the task definition, different types of targets in stance detection, features set used, and various machine learning approaches applied. Our survey reports state-of-the-art results on the existing benchmark datasets on stance detection, and discusses the most effective approaches. In addition, we explore the emerging trends and different applications of stance detection on social media, including opinion mining and prediction and recently using it for fake news detection. The study concludes by discussing the gaps in the current existing research and highlights the possible future directions for stance detection on social media.}

Especially after the recent proliferation of online content through channels such as social media sites, news portals, and forums; solutions to problems such as sentiment analysis, sarcasm/controversy/veracity/rumour/fake news detection, and argument mining gained increasing impact and significance, revealed with large volumes of related scientific publications. In this article, we tackle an important problem from the same family and present a survey of stance detection in social media posts and (online) regular texts. Although stance detection is defined in different ways in different application settings, the most common definition is “automatic classification of the stance of the producer of a piece of text, towards a target, into one of these three classes: {Favor, Against, Neither}.” Our survey includes definitions of related problems and concepts, classifications of the proposed approaches so far, descriptions of the relevant datasets and tools, and related outstanding issues. Stance detection is a recent natural language processing topic with diverse application areas, and our survey article on this newly emerging topic will act as a significant resource for interested researchers and practitioners.},

The submitted systems are expected to automatically determine whether the author of a Chinese microblog is in favor of the given target, against the given target, or whether neither inference is likely. Different from regular evaluation tasks on sentiment analysis, the microblog text may or may not contain the target of interest, and the opinion expressed may or may not be towards to the target of interest. We designed two tasks. Task A is a mandatory supervised task which detects stance towards five targets of interest with given labeled data. Task B is an optional unsupervised task which gives only unlabeled data. Our shared task has had sixteen team participants for Task A and five results of Task B. The highest F-score obtained was 0.7106 for Task A and 0.4687 for Task B, respectively.",

    abstract = "Misinformation such as fake news is one of the big challenges of our society. Research on automated fact-checking has proposed methods based on supervised learning, but these approaches do not consider external evidence apart from labeled training instances. Recent approaches counter this deficit by considering external sources related to a claim. However, these methods require substantial feature modeling and rich lexicons. This paper overcomes these limitations of prior work with an end-to-end model for evidence-aware credibility assessment of arbitrary textual claims, without any human intervention. It presents a neural network model that judiciously aggregates signals from external evidence articles, the language of these articles and the trustworthiness of their sources. It also derives informative features for generating user-comprehensible explanations that makes the neural network predictions transparent to the end-user. Experiments with four datasets and ablation studies show the strength of our method.",

abstract="The problem of identifying and correctly attributing speaker stance in human communication is addressed in this paper. The data set consists of political blogs dealing with the 2016 British referendum. A cognitive-functional framework is adopted with data annotated for six notional stance categories: contrariety, hypotheticality, necessity, prediction, source of knowledge, and uncertainty. We show that these categories can be implemented in a text classification task and automatically detected. To this end, we propose a large set of lexical and syntactic linguistic features. These features were tested and classification experiments were implemented using different algorithms. We achieved accuracy of up to 30{\%} for the six-class experiments, which is not fully satisfactory. As a second step, we calculated the pair-wise combinations of the stance categories. The contrariety and necessity binary classification achieved the best results with up to 71{\%} accuracy.",

To tackle this problem, most of the prior studies have been explored the traditional deep learning models, e.g., LSTM and GRU. However, in compared to these traditional approaches, recently proposed densely connected Bi-LSTM and nested LSTMs architectures effectively address the vanishing-gradient and overfitting problems as well as dealing with long-term dependencies. In this paper, we propose a neural ensemble model that adopts the strengths of these two LSTM variants to learn better long-term dependencies, where each module coupled with an attention mechanism that amplifies the contribution of important elements in the final representation. We also employ a multi-kernel convolution on top of them to extract the higher-level tweet representations. Results of extensive experiments on single and multi-target stance detection datasets show that our proposed method achieves substantial improvement over the current state-of-the-art deep learning based methods.",

    abstract = "The experimental landscape in natural language processing for social media is too fragmented. Each year, new shared tasks and datasets are proposed, ranging from classics like sentiment analysis to irony detection or emoji prediction. Therefore, it is unclear what the current state of the art is, as there is no standardized evaluation protocol, neither a strong set of baselines trained on such domain-specific data. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation framework (TweetEval) consisting of seven heterogeneous Twitter-specific classification tasks. We also provide a strong set of baselines as starting point, and compare different language modeling pre-training strategies. Our initial experiments show the effectiveness of starting off with existing pre-trained generic language models, and continue training them on Twitter corpora.",

We propose a probabilistic approach to stance classification in tweets, which models stance, target of stance, and sentiment of tweet, jointly. Instead of simply conjoining the sentiment or target variables as extra variables to the feature space, we use a novel formulation to incorporate three-way interactions among sentiment-stance-input variables and three-way interactions among target-stance-input variables. The proposed specification intuitively aims to discriminate sentiment features from target features for stance classification. In addition, regularizing a single stance classifier, which handles all targets, acts as a soft weight-sharing among them. We demonstrate that discriminative training of this model achieves the state-of-the-art results in supervised stance classification, and its generative training obtains competitive results in the weakly supervised setting.",
